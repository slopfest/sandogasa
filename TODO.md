- (2026-06-19) Target-type / version-scheme abstraction — the rest of
  the big piece. Live-test it when updating `archlinux-keyring`'s
  `debian/trixie`. A per-target notion driving `changelog::
  rebuild_version` + `normalize_top_stanza`: Ubuntu PPA `~<codename>+N`;
  Debian backports `~bpoN+M`; proposed-updates `+debNuM`;
  unstable/testing = no suffix. Branch taxonomy → target: `master`/
  `main`/`debian/unstable` → Debian unstable (`dput` default, or
  mentors for a new pkg / proposed NMU); `ubuntu/*` or an Ubuntu-release
  codename → PPA; `debian/<codename>` (e.g. archlinux-keyring's
  `debian/trixie`) → special, kept current in stable. Also rename the
  `codename` value → `distribution` (what pbuilder/gbp/changelog call
  it), keeping "codename" only for the `~<codename>` version suffix.
  The build-suite decoupling means a target has both a changelog
  *distribution* and a *build suite*, on top of the version scheme.

- (2026-06-19, low priority) Optional per-package waiving of a specific
  salsa-ci job (e.g. `test-uscan` fails on trixie when the watch file
  uses a uscan standard newer than trixie's uscan). Not blocking: `push`
  (CI watch) is separate from `upload`/`tag`, so a red job doesn't stop
  an upload. Keep it a targeted job-skip, not a blanket relaxation
  (proposed-updates should face the normal checks).

  (Proposed-updates themselves — `~debNuM` version, `gbp dch --stable`,
  salsa-ci preset, Debian-host gate, dput-default upload — and the
  `update` default-target upload guard are all done.)

Note (2026-06-19): bulk is deliberately **local-branch only** — a local
branch *is* the opt-in. To include a release, check it out once; to
drop it, delete the local branch. (Remote-inclusive bulk was
considered and rejected.)

Done (shipped): the `push`/`upload`/`tag` stages, per-job CI watch
progress, `git push -u`→plain-push simplification, `--quiet` mode, the
`--source` merge-source override, the `fixup` subcommand, stale-chroot
auto-refresh (`--refresh-chroot`/`--no-refresh-chroot`), grouped
`--help` sections, the safer bulk run (Ubuntu-codename selection
via `ubuntu-distro-info`, EOL skip + `--include-eol`, newest-first
order, confirmation + `--yes`), and the `update` subcommand
(new-upstream import of the Debian branch, sharing the build→…→tag
pipeline; `--build-suite`, dput-default upload).

## fedora-review-digest

- (2026-06-23) pyp2spec support: a Python checklist + post-import
  boilerplate (terminology: "Python package (from PyPI)", not module).
  Generator detection is already wired; `infer`/`render_post_import`
  just need the Python branch.
- (2026-06-23, later) Run `fedora-review -b <id>` ourselves instead of
  only pointing at an existing result dir.

Done (shipped): the core digest + interactive `+1/0/-1` finalization,
`--post` (comment + `fedora-review` flag + status POST + bug claim) and
the `config` subcommand, rust2rpm spec/license fixes, the
builds-and-installs item reading fedora-review's install verdict,
interactive issue resolution (keep/explain/remove → APPROVED flip), and
the statically-linked-deps license verification (build-log LICENSE
SUMMARY vs the spec's folded `License:`, confirmed on rust-git-absorb).

## ebranch

- Second-level branch-request escalation: when a `needinfo?` ping
  (the level-1 escalation `escalate` already does) goes unanswered
  for another N days, file a releng ticket. Blocked on a Forgejo
  client — releng's tracker moved from Pagure to Forgejo, which
  sandogasa has no client for yet. Also needs the report's
  per-request escalation state to grow from `pinged: bool` to a
  level (none → needinfo'd → releng-filed) so `escalate` knows
  which step each request is on. Plan: add a `sandogasa-forgejo`
  crate (issue create/search), extend `BranchRequest`, and add the
  releng-filing branch to `escalate`.

## sandogasa-report

- Debug CVE/security bug reporting: the query may be too narrow or
  the keyword filter may not match Bugzilla's actual keyword values.
  Test with known CVE bugs and compare against manual Bugzilla search.
- (2026-06-24) Forgejo: detect a closed PR whose work landed via a
  *reworded/rebased* commit (different SHA, so the `head.sha`-on-
  default-branch check used for the "applied" state misses it). Idea:
  go PR → linked issue (the PR body's `Fixes #N`) → the issue's
  timeline cross-references, and look for a default-branch commit
  authored by the user that references the same issue; mark it
  "applied" too. Fuzzier than the SHA check (a different person could
  reference the same issue) and costs extra API calls per closed PR,
  so gate it and confirm author identity. Only worth it if the plain
  SHA check proves to miss real cases.
- (2026-06-24) Document the required GitLab and GitHub token
  permissions/scopes in the README, the way the Forgejo
  authentication section now does (exact scopes per operation, and
  which are only needed by `config`'s token validation). Determine
  the *minimum* fine-grained scopes — currently the GitHub side is
  being used with a legacy/coarse-grained classic PAT, so figure out
  the least-privilege fine-grained-PAT permission set (Contents,
  Pull requests, Metadata, etc.) and the GitLab equivalent (`read_api`
  vs `api`, and whether `read_user` is needed for the username
  lookup). Cross-check against `validate_token` and the actual
  endpoints each `*_report` calls.
