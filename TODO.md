- (2026-06-19) Target-type / version-scheme abstraction — the rest of
  the big piece. Live-test it when updating `archlinux-keyring`'s
  `debian/trixie`. A per-target notion driving `changelog::
  rebuild_version` + `normalize_top_stanza`: Ubuntu PPA `~<codename>+N`;
  Debian backports `~bpoN+M`; proposed-updates `+debNuM`;
  unstable/testing = no suffix. Branch taxonomy → target: `master`/
  `main`/`debian/unstable` → Debian unstable (`dput` default, or
  mentors for a new pkg / proposed NMU); `ubuntu/*` or an Ubuntu-release
  codename → PPA; `debian/<codename>` (e.g. archlinux-keyring's
  `debian/trixie`) → special, kept current in stable. Also rename the
  `codename` value → `distribution` (what pbuilder/gbp/changelog call
  it), keeping "codename" only for the `~<codename>` version suffix.
  The build-suite decoupling means a target has both a changelog
  *distribution* and a *build suite*, on top of the version scheme.

- (2026-06-19) Proposed-updates: remaining bits. The changelog/version
  (`~debNuM`, tilde — sorts older), `gbp dch --stable`, salsa-ci preset
  (RELEASE=codename, no backports), and the whole-run **Debian-host
  gate** are done (in rebuild, auto-detected for `debian/<codename>`).
  Still to do:
  - The analogous **`update` (to-unstable) upload guard**: hard-fail on
    a non-Debian host when uploading to the default target; exempt an
    explicit `--upload-target`. (`update`'s changelog gen works on
    Ubuntu, so gate only the upload — unlike proposed-updates.) Reuse
    `host::is_debian`. See DEVELOPMENT.md.
  - (low priority) Optional per-package waiving of a specific salsa-ci
    job (e.g. `test-uscan` fails on trixie when the watch file uses a
    uscan standard newer than trixie's uscan). Not blocking: `push`
    (CI watch) is separate from `upload`/`tag`, so a red job doesn't
    stop an upload. Keep it a targeted job-skip, not a blanket
    relaxation (proposed-updates should face the normal checks).

Note (2026-06-19): bulk is deliberately **local-branch only** — a local
branch *is* the opt-in. To include a release, check it out once; to
drop it, delete the local branch. (Remote-inclusive bulk was
considered and rejected.)

Done (shipped): the `push`/`upload`/`tag` stages, per-job CI watch
progress, `git push -u`→plain-push simplification, `--quiet` mode, the
`--source` merge-source override, the `fixup` subcommand, stale-chroot
auto-refresh (`--refresh-chroot`/`--no-refresh-chroot`), grouped
`--help` sections, the safer bulk run (Ubuntu-codename selection
via `ubuntu-distro-info`, EOL skip + `--include-eol`, newest-first
order, confirmation + `--yes`), and the `update` subcommand
(new-upstream import of the Debian branch, sharing the build→…→tag
pipeline; `--build-suite`, dput-default upload).

## ebranch

- Second-level branch-request escalation: when a `needinfo?` ping
  (the level-1 escalation `escalate` already does) goes unanswered
  for another N days, file a releng ticket. Blocked on a Forgejo
  client — releng's tracker moved from Pagure to Forgejo, which
  sandogasa has no client for yet. Also needs the report's
  per-request escalation state to grow from `pinged: bool` to a
  level (none → needinfo'd → releng-filed) so `escalate` knows
  which step each request is on. Plan: add a `sandogasa-forgejo`
  crate (issue create/search), extend `BranchRequest`, and add the
  releng-filing branch to `escalate`.

## sandogasa-report

- Debug CVE/security bug reporting: the query may be too narrow or
  the keyword filter may not match Bugzilla's actual keyword values.
  Test with known CVE bugs and compare against manual Bugzilla search.
